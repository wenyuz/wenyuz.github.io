I study fundamental dynamics underlying intricate tropical phenomena, using idealized models that distill particular processes. My research challenged the conventional understanding of ___TC interactions with ocean mixed layer and atmospheric wind shears___, and explained conceptually ___how the observed monsoon extent emerges from effects of individual ingredients___. 

I look into alterations in atmospheric dynamics over a broad spectrum of spatial and temporal scales that lead to profound changes of regional climate. This includes ___an unexpected early-summer Hadley contraction___ that shifts the subtropical monsoon equatorward, ___an eastward shift in the MJO teleconnection___ that amplifies MJO impacts on the Pacific-North America region, and ___changes in local radiative-convective processes___ that intensify tropical convection and affect diurnal and seasonal amplitude of land temperature. 

Besides these projects focused on atmospheric dynamics, my research also touched upon _remote effect of the extratropical land on the deep-tropical rainfall_ and _interactions between atmospheric jets and extratropical ocean circulation_.
