## Tropical Dynamics

TCs are a major threat to coastal populations. One difficulty for studying TCs is that they are often embedded in complex and evolving large-scale state, which prevent a clear view of their interactions with environmental factors. By coupling radiative-convective physics to f-plane dynamics, I developed an idealized model that simulates a world filled with TCs but without large-scale flows. It allows me to study fundamental dynamics of TCs and their sensitivity to specific environmental factors. Based on this framework, I have identified limitations in classic theories of TC intensity and structure [1]. Moreover, by coupling the surface with ocean, I studied how the surface cooling near the eyewall weakens the TC intensity. To my surprise, a stratified atmospheric boundary layer develops and limits the weakening [2]. In another work, by introducing vertical wind shears, I illustrated that the sensitivity of TC genesis to the large-scale thermodynamic state is distinct between conditions without and with wind shears, which profoundly alter the procedure of the TC genesis [3]. In the future, I plan to apply this framework more widely to questions such as how the insolation diurnal cycle and island topography influence TCs.
