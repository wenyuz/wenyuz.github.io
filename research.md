For tropical dynamics, I aim to expose fundamental dynamics underlying intricate tropical phenomena, using idealized models that distill particular processes. My research challenged the conventional understanding of TC interactions with ocean mixed layer and atmospheric wind shears, and explained conceptually how the observed monsoon extent emerges from effects of individual ingredients such as seasonal insolation, land-sea geometry and soil moisture. 

For regional climate change, I look into alterations in atmospheric dynamics over a broad spectrum of spatial and temporal scales that lead to profound changes of regional climate. My work has identified an unexpected early-summer contraction in the planetary-scale Hadley circulation that shifts the subtropical monsoon equatorward, an eastward shift in the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) teleconnection that amplifies MJO impacts on the Pacific-North America region, and changes in local radiative-convective processes that intensify tropical extreme convection and affect the diurnal and seasonal amplitude of land temperature. 

Besides these projects focused on atmospheric dynamics, my research also touched upon remote effect of the extratropical land on the deep-tropical rainfall and interactions between atmospheric jets and extratropical ocean circulation.
