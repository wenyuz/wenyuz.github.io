I study fundamental dynamics underlying intricate tropical phenomena, using idealized models that distill particular processes. My research challenged the conventional understanding of [*TC interactions with ocean mixed layer and atmospheric wind shears*](#distill-TC-dynamics-in-idealized-models), and explained conceptually [*how the observed monsoon extent emerges from effects of individual ingredients*](#monsoon-extent-as-an-emergent profuct-of-individual-ingredient). 

I look into alterations in atmospheric dynamics that profoundly impact regional climate, over a broad spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. This includes [*an unexpected early-summer Hadley contraction*](#seasonal-dependent-meridional-shift-in-the-subtropical-circulation) that shifts the subtropical monsoon equatorward, [*an eastward shift in the MJO teleconnection*](#eastward-shift-in-the-MJO-teleconnection) that amplifies MJO impacts on the Pacific-North America region, and [*changes in local radiative-convective processes*](local-changes-in-the-radiative-convective-processes) that intensify tropical convection and affect diurnal and seasonal amplitude of land temperature. 

Besides these projects focused on atmospheric dynamics, my research also touched upon [*remote effect of the extratropical land on the deep-tropical rainfall*] and [*interactions between atmospheric jets and extratropical ocean circulation*].
