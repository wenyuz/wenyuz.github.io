I study fundamental dynamics underlying intricate tropical phenomena, using idealized models that distill particular processes. My research _challenged the conventional understanding of TC interactions with ocean mixed layer and atmospheric wind shears_, and _explained conceptually how the observed monsoon extent emerges from effects of individual ingredients_. 

I look into alterations in atmospheric dynamics over a broad spectrum of spatial and temporal scales that lead to profound changes of regional climate. This includes _an unexpected early-summer Hadley contraction that shifts the subtropical monsoon equatorward_, _an eastward shift in the MJO teleconnection that amplifies MJO impacts on the Pacific-North America region_, and _changes in local radiative-convective processes that intensify tropical convection and affect diurnal and seasonal amplitude of land temperature_. 

Besides these projects focused on atmospheric dynamics, my research also touched upon _remote effect of the extratropical land on the deep-tropical rainfall_ and _interactions between atmospheric jets and extratropical ocean circulation_.
