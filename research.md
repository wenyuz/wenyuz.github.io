## Overview

The Earthâ€™s climate, with its daunting complexity, is undergoing profound anthropogenic changes. As a tropical meteorologist and a climate scientist, I seek to [advance our understanding of tropical dynamics](#tropical-dynamics) and to [inform climate change impacts at regional scale](#regional-climate-change). For the first theme, I have focused on fundamental dynamics of tropical phenomena. This emphasizes utilizing simplified models to distill particular processes from involved systems and to gain theoretical understandings of observed features. For the second theme, I am interested in regional climate changes that arises from alterations in atmospheric dynamics. I apply advanced diagnosis to analyze comprehensive climate models and combine theories with carefully-designed model experiments to establish causality.

##Tropical Dynamics
In the tropics, moist convection is coupled with tropical dynamics and organized into various forms, ranging from synoptic tropical cyclones (TCs, a general name for hurricanes and typhoons), to regional monsoons, and to planetary-scale Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). I have a general interest in these convectively coupled phenomena, and have investigated some basic yet still challenging questions, such as, how the large-scale state influences TC intensity and genesis? what sets the extent and onset of the monsoon? 

Distill fundamental TC dynamics in idealized models [1-3]: TCs are a major threat to coastal populations. One difficulty for studying TCs is that they are often embedded in complex and evolving large-scale state, which prevent a clear view of their interactions with environmental factors. By coupling radiative-convective physics to f-plane dynamics, I developed an idealized model that simulates a world filled with TCs but without large-scale flows. It allows me to study fundamental dynamics of TCs and their sensitivity to specific environmental factors. Based on this framework, I have identified limitations in classic theories of TC intensity and structure [1]. Moreover, by coupling the surface with ocean, I studied how the surface cooling near the eyewall weakens the TC intensity. To my surprise, a stratified atmospheric boundary layer develops and limits the weakening [2]. In another work, by introducing vertical wind shears, I illustrated that the sensitivity of TC genesis to the large-scale thermodynamic state is distinct between conditions without and with wind shears, which profoundly alter the procedure of the TC genesis [3]. In the future, I plan to apply this framework more widely to questions such as how the insolation diurnal cycle and island topography influence TCs.
