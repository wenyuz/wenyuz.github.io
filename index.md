I work on Earth & Environmental Sciences at Lawrence Berkeley Lab.   
I was a Postdoc at UC San Diego, working with [Shang-Ping Xie](http://scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu/sxie/).   
I completed my PhD at Princeton University, advised by [Isaac Held](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/isaac-held-homepage/).   

I seek to understand the formation, variability and change of the climate system. My research has looked into      
1) Physics of tropical phenomena, like hurricanes and monsoons       
2) Changes in regional climate under anthropogenic warming
