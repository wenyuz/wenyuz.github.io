## About Me
I work on Earth & Environmental Sciences at Lawrence Berkeley Lab.
I was a Postdoc at UC San Diego, working with [Shang-Ping Xie].
I completed my PhD at Princeton University, advised by [Isaac Held].

My research interests are 1) Dynaimcs of tropical climate and weather phenomena,including Tropical Cyclones, Monsoons and Intertropical Convergence Zone; and 2) Regional climate changes that arise from alterations in large-scale circulation, tropical-extratropical teleconnection and local radiative-convective processes
