I work on Earth & Environmental Sciences at Lawrence Berkeley Lab. I was a Postdoc at UC San Diego with [Shang-Ping Xie]. I completed my PhD under the guidance of [Isaac Held] at Princeton University.

My research interests are 1) Dynaimcs of the tropical climate and weather phenomena,including Tropical Cyclones (TCs), Maddeng-Julian Oscillation (MJO), Monsoons and Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and 2) Regional climate changes that arise from alterations in large-scale circulation, tropical-extratropical teleconnection and local radiative-convective processes
